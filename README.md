# 🛠️ Mini Python Projects

Welcome to my **Mini Python Projects** repository!  
This repo serves as a collection of small, beginner-friendly Python projects that I'm building as part of my programming learning journey. Each project is designed to focus on a specific concept or skill in Python programming.

## 📁 Projects

### 📌 Project 1: Programming Quiz App
A simple terminal-based quiz application that asks the user five programming-related questions. The app tracks the score based on correct answers and gives feedback after each question.

**Concepts practiced:**
- Taking user input
- Conditional statements
- String manipulation
- Basic scoring logic

### 📌 Project 2: Number Guessing Game
A simple Python terminal-based Number Guessing Game where the program randomly selects a number, and the user has to guess it. The game provides feedback on wrong guesses, tracks how many attempts were made, and congratulates the player once they guess correctly.

**Concepts practiced:**
- User inputs the upper limit for the random number.
- Ensures only valid numeric input is accepted.
- Random number is generated within the chosen range.
- Tracks the number of attempts made by the player.
- Provides feedback on correct and incorrect guesses.
