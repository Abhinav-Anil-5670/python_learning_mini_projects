# 🛠️ Mini Python Projects

Welcome to my **Mini Python Projects** repository!  
This repo serves as a collection of small, beginner-friendly Python projects that I'm building as part of my programming learning journey. Each project is designed to focus on a specific concept or skill in Python programming.

## 📁 Projects

### 📌 Project 1: Programming Quiz App
A simple terminal-based quiz application that asks the user five programming-related questions. The app tracks the score based on correct answers and gives feedback after each question.

**Concepts practiced:**
- Taking user input
- Conditional statements
- String manipulation
- Basic scoring logic

### 📌 Project 2: Number Guessing Game
A simple Python terminal-based Number Guessing Game where the program randomly selects a number, and the user has to guess it. The game provides feedback on wrong guesses, tracks how many attempts were made, and congratulates the player once they guess correctly.

**Concepts practiced:**
- User inputs the upper limit for the random number.
- Ensures only valid numeric input is accepted.
- Random number is generated within the chosen range.
- Tracks the number of attempts made by the player.
- Provides feedback on correct and incorrect guesses.

### 📌 Project 3: Rock-Paper-Scissors Game
A Python terminal-based Rock-Paper-Scissors game where the user plays against the computer. The game continues until the player chooses to quit. It keeps track of the total wins for both the player and the computer, declaring results after each round.

**Concepts practiced:**
- Handling user input with validation.
- Generating random computer choices.
- Using conditionals to determine round outcomes.
- Implementing game loops for repeated play.
- Tracking scores across multiple rounds.

### 📌 Project 4: Text Adventure Game
A simple terminal-based text adventure where the user makes choices that determine their fate. The app presents scenarios, takes input, and branches the story based on decisions. Each choice leads to different outcomes, including success or failure.

**Concepts practiced:**
- Taking user input.
- Conditional statements.
- Nested branching logic.
- Storytelling through code.

### 📌 Project 5: Command-Line Password Manager
This is a simple, terminal-based application for securely storing and managing account passwords. The app allows users to add new account credentials and view existing ones. All passwords are encrypted before being saved to a local file, ensuring they are not stored in plain text.

The project uses the cryptography library to handle the encryption and decryption of passwords, providing a basic layer of security.

**Concepts practiced:**
- File I/O: Reading from and writing to text files (passwords.txt, key.key) using different modes ('r', 'w', 'a', 'rb', 'wb').
- Using External Libraries: Installing and utilizing third-party packages like cryptography to add advanced functionality.
- Understanding the basic workflow of encrypting data before writing it and decrypting it after reading.
- Working with different data types and converting between them (e.g., strings to bytes with .encode() and bytes to strings with .decode()).

### 📌 Project 6: Dice Game (Pig-Style Scoring)
This is a simple, interactive dice game playable in the terminal. The game supports 2–4 players, each taking turns to roll a die and accumulate points. Players can roll as many times as they want during their turn, but rolling a 1 resets their turn’s score to zero and ends the turn. The first player to reach or exceed 50 points wins, but all players still get to complete the current round before the winner is declared.

**Concepts practiced:**
- Loops and Conditionals: Using while and for loops along with nested conditionals to handle turn logic and game progression.
- Random Number Generation: Using Python’s random module to simulate dice rolls.
- Data Structures: Storing player scores in a list and updating values dynamically.
- Input Handling: Validating user input for number of players and in-game decisions.
- Game Logic Design: Managing rounds, enforcing rules (like resetting score on rolling a 1), and fairly determining a winner.

## 🎯 Purpose

This repository is meant to:
- Practice core Python concepts through hands-on projects.
- Build a solid foundation for future, more complex applications.
- Track and showcase my learning progress.
