# 🛠️ Mini Python Projects

Welcome to my **Mini Python Projects** repository!  
This repo serves as a collection of small, beginner-friendly Python projects that I'm building as part of my programming learning journey. Each project is designed to focus on a specific concept or skill in Python programming.

## 📁 Projects

### 📌 Project 1: Programming Quiz App
A simple terminal-based quiz application that asks the user five programming-related questions. The app tracks the score based on correct answers and gives feedback after each question.

**Concepts practiced:**
- Taking user input
- Conditional statements
- String manipulation
- Basic scoring logic

### 📌 Project 2: Number Guessing Game
A simple Python terminal-based Number Guessing Game where the program randomly selects a number, and the user has to guess it. The game provides feedback on wrong guesses, tracks how many attempts were made, and congratulates the player once they guess correctly.

**Concepts practiced:**
- User inputs the upper limit for the random number.
- Ensures only valid numeric input is accepted.
- Random number is generated within the chosen range.
- Tracks the number of attempts made by the player.
- Provides feedback on correct and incorrect guesses.

### 📌 Project 3: Rock-Paper-Scissors Game
A Python terminal-based Rock-Paper-Scissors game where the user plays against the computer. The game continues until the player chooses to quit. It keeps track of the total wins for both the player and the computer, declaring results after each round.

**Concepts practiced:**
- Handling user input with validation.
- Generating random computer choices.
- Using conditionals to determine round outcomes.
- Implementing game loops for repeated play.
- Tracking scores across multiple rounds.

### 📌 Project 4: Text Adventure Game
A simple terminal-based text adventure where the user makes choices that determine their fate. The app presents scenarios, takes input, and branches the story based on decisions. Each choice leads to different outcomes, including success or failure.

**Concepts practiced:**
- Taking user input.
- Conditional statements.
- Nested branching logic.
- Storytelling through code.
